**Which of the following jobs do you think is the hardest one? Doctor/Officer/Government Worker**
## Sample
I think doctors is the hardest job.  

First, doctors suffer from the pressure of professional knowledge. Their professinal skills would be tested regularly. If they don't pass the test, the goverment would revoke their license.  

Secondly, they suffer from the pressure of patients. The relatives of patient often harbor unrealistic expectation toward the doctors, and this expectation drives them irrational. For example, even the most famous doctor could not cure patient with terminal cancer, but realtives of patient would channel this pressure to doctors. That's the reason why doctor is a hard job.  

**Do you agree with the following statement? Students should visit some museums, like science museum, art museum and history museum.**
## Sample
Yeah! I agree with it.  

Firstly, museums introduce me the world of science. After visiting the museum, people generaly would be more motivated to learn. Last friday, I took my friend Jim to Shanghai Science Museum to witness the prototype of a supercomputer, that was when he started learning computer science.

Secondlyï¼Œstudents nowadays stay in the classroom all the time, so a visit to museums is like a field trip. They could know each other bettwe by discussing about interesting topics along the way. Perfect way to make friends and have fun.

**Whaich of the following job you would like to do? Plant trees/ build bicycle trails/ clean the street**
## Sample

I would like to plant more trees.    

Firstly, more trees in the street would make people feel in the nature. People would spend more time outdoors or do some sports to relax.  

Secondly, trees could absorb the exhaust gas emmited by cars and factories. Shanghai is in desperate need of more trees because the quality of air is in serious condition. Without more trees to clean the air, people would wear masks all day long.
