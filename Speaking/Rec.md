```Which of the following jobs do you think is the hardest one? Doctor/Officer/Government Worker```
I think doctors is the hardest job.
First, doctors suffer from the pressure of professional knowledge. Their professinal skills would be tested regularly. If they don't pass the test, the goverment would revoke their license.  
Secondly, they suffer from the pressure of patients. The relatives of patient often harbor unrealistic expectation toward the doctors, and this expectation drives them irrational. For example, even the most famous doctor could not cure patient with terminal cancer, but realtives of patient would channel this pressure to doctors. That's the reason why doctor is a hard job.
