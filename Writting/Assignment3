## Writting
For most students, there will be many free time for entertainment after a whole day's hard work. Although many of them would choose playing cell phone and listening to music, I would like to find a part-time job and do something meaningful.  

First of all, doing part-time job and making contribution to the society is a leisure. Consider that you were doing volunteer job in the train station. When you give your hands to those who need help, for example some passengers who missed the train or someone who lost their way. It will be a great honor to accept their appreciations. It feels like I become a block in the whole building where our sociaty located.  However, playing cell phone in your dorm or listening to music can only provide personal leisure for me, which cannot be passed to other people.  

Secondly, economical independent is a challenging task for college students. By doing part-time job, I can afford my daily expense without my familiy's help. Also the economical pressure of my family would be released, more money could be spared for other usage. Nowadays many young people lost their ability of making money and live on themselves, thus becoming a worm attached on their parents body. It's a shame to rely on your parents when you are old enough. Doing some part-time job is a good preperation for economical independent, since it proves that you are able to live on your own.  

Finally, doing part-time job is an opportunity to improve our comprehensive ability and broaden our horizon. When we leave the campus and work in the society, there are many important thing we need to learn. From your collegues, boss and costomers, we can learn their way of talking, the attitude towards social issues and the behavior when encountering some problem. Definately we cannot learn those ability in campus while they are quite important in our future career. Besides academic activities, learning those preliminary knowledge for social life is much more benefitial than playing in your dorm.  

In conclusion, doing part-time job both improves our living ability and makes our lesure time meaningful for us and our sociaty. So I would choose finding a part-time job as my extra-curriculmn activities.
