Whether using items made by hand or items made by machine is obviously a controversial question. As far as I am concerned, I prefer machine made products in today's social and industrial condition.

Admiteddly, hand made products are of higher value than machine made ones, both in status and economic sense. Wearing a handmade Swiss Watch created by famous craftsman shows your economic level and social status. However, as for general people, does these handmade products really necessary? As the advancement of technology and the improvement of industrail productivity, nearly all the staff could be made by machine with similar quality with handcrafts. The wide utilizatioin of machine made item has become a visible trend. 

Firstly, purchasing machine made item could save us a lot of time. As the pipeline and electricity engine being applied in all the factories, the time a products need to be made has decreased greatly over the years. Consequently, millions of clothes, furnitures and daily staff has been made every minute and delivered into supermarkets. We can conveniently go and buy what we need in a second by tipping our mobile phones. On the contrary, hand made products, limited by the speed of workers, cannot been made in such a short time. For example, if someone wants a hand made cloth, no doubt that he would wait for days or weeks to get his order. What a waste of time.

Secondly, machine made item is more precise and intricated than manually made ones. Today's machine has a really high precision on handling small items. For example, a machenical watch made by machine is certainly more precise that by human's hand. A car's engine would be more reliable if it was made by machine. No matter how skillful a worker is, the precision of human's body could not reach minimeter level. 

Finally, due to the large quantity of machine made products, purchasing those items would be economical friendly. Due to the large quantity of production and the decline of workers' salary, the price of a single product will decline according to the basic theory of economics. More items could be bought with the same amount of money if they were made by machine. Certainly, it reflects the influence of rapidly improved social productivity. As for hand made items, for instance, a set of manully made furniture would cost twice or more than those were produced through pipelines. If no special requirement, I would take the cheaper one.

In conlusion, using machine made products is benifitial in saving time, money and improving reliability. That's the reason why I prefer machine made items.
