For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to peoplr is more important than studying hard in school.

## Original
Nowadays, a relationship with collegues, bosses and customers plays an indispensible role in modern work. It raises a question that whether relating well to people is more important than studying hard in school? As far as I am concerned, I disagree with this statement and reckon that the abilities earned by studying at school is much more important.

Firstly, despite of academic knowledge, the ability of independent study and comprehensive quality learned from school is what valuable, which can enhance the efficiency of future work. During study, we might meet many unfamiliar problems, which can only be solved by ourselves. For example, if someone encountered some complex but tiny problem, he would choose to go to the library or searching on the Internet for a solution. During this process, the ability of self-learning will be improved, which is impossible in relating with people. Essentially, your comprehensive quality is the very foundation of your success in the future job.

Moreover, the study in school will build your courage and confidence when confronting with difficulties. Consider that you failed important exam at school time to time, we need time to recover our sorrow and stand up again to face the new challenge. It is simmilar to some circumstances we might encounter in the work. Without the courage and confidence built in thousand failures, it is likely to make us frustrated whenever making drawbacks. For example, my uncle Jim is an outgoing person who keeps a wide range of social relationship, while he did not accept college education. However he often gets upset and complains about the difficulties in his work. I assume if he took the higher education, he would be more calm and paced when facing problems. 

Finally, the ability of keeping good relationship with people sometimes cannot basically solve the problem. Whether you are an engineer, a police officer, or middle school teacher, what defines your success in your work is what you have done. Only by chatting and socialing with other people will not help you make any progress in the actual projects. For example, if you are a doctor, what determines your success is the quality of your medical technique and how many patients you have cured, which obviously cannot be demonstrated by the ability of relating with people.

In conclusion, although the ability of relating with people is quite important in work, it cannot outweigh the importance of hard study in school in your success of a future job.

Everyone in the society is seeking for success in career, but what is the key factor of becoming sucessful? There are two choices- **good networking and hardworking**. Although someone tend to choose the first one, I still hold the idea that hardworking at school should be a more important factor of success. Without hardworking at school, one can hardly gain success in the future.  

To gain success in our future career, people have to build up solid knowledge base for certain fields. And working hard at school is, definitely, the most effective way to equip oneself with background knowledge. Although sometimes we mey find there are some minor diffenrence between theories and reality, these theories are still the most important foundation assisting us to understand the practice. Take myself as an example. I am now a senior major in journalism. I studies how to interview, how to write summaries and journals and how to make comments on subjects at school. I worked very hard and in the third year, I got a chance to be an intern in China Economic Daily. During this time, I totally put mu knowledge into practice and handle the real journalism with only a few problems. If I had not studied har and had a **good command of journalism**, how could I have been qualified for this internship?  

Moreover, comparing with getting well related with others, more skills can be cultivated in the process of studying hard. These skills may play indispensable role in a future job to obtain success. For example, when I was in high school, in order to get higher score, I would make efforts to write down every points illustrated in the class, with bunches of details. This forced me to practive shorthand which contributed significantly to my first internship as an administrative assistant. My boss was oftern impressed by my perfect meeting records. It is clearly that students are able to acquire many skills that are essential for their future job.  

Admittedly, getting well related with others can help people broaden their social network, facilitating their communication and cooperation with others. In this way, they are more likely to fulfill thier tasks or projects with less obstacles. However one may still fail to accomplish his or her projects due to the lack of fundamental supporting theories and skills. Only by studying hard can an individual employ what he learned in school to finish their work successfully.  

All in all, hardworking should be the key factor of being successful. It provides foundations for our success in the future.
