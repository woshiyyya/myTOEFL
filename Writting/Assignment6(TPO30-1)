In the reading passage, the writter claims that the "burning mirror" might not be created by Greeks and that might just be a myth or story. However, the lecturer does not agree with this assumption and refutes the reasons presented in passage.

First of all, concerning the technological ability of ancient Greeks, the reading passage assume that Greeks' technology was not advanced enough to make a meters wide copper mirror with precise parabolic curvature. However, the professor refutes by a fact that a large parabolic mirror can be formed by a large quantity of small ones. If the ancient Greeks knew about this property, it would be possible that they could assembly many small soomth mirrors to form the large "burning mirror".  

Secondly, the passage presents an evidence that it would take a long time to set wood on fire using mirrors 30 meters away, thus to prove that this weapon is inpractical and ineffective. However, the professor refered that wood was not the only material on Roman warship that could be on fire. There was a sticky matieral called "pitch" which could be lighted within a few seconds, which would quikly set fire on other things on the ship. This makes the "burning mirror" effective eough to be a weapon.  

Finally, the burning mirror can serve as a special attact compared with flaming arror, a weapon that Romans had already made preparation for. Although the flaming arror has simmilar effect with burning arror as the reading material says, Roman soldiers were so familiar with it. Once the flaming arror were shot on board and caught fire, Roman sodiers would put out the fire instantly. While for the burning mirror, it can set on fire without letting the Romans know. They just saw the mirror but not the fire.  

In conclusion, the assumption of the reading material is not convincing. The burining mirror is possible to exist.
