It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

## Writting
It has been a heated discussion about whether a person should specialize in one specific subject or possess wide range of knowledge. Every individual would have his own answer, especially in todays diversified world. I would agree that having a broad knowledge is a better choice.  

A broad knowledge can help us interpret the whole world in different aspects, instruct us to transform the world better. With a wide range of knowledge in many academic subjects, you can find many subtle secrets of the nature that others cannot even notice. When you see a rainbow hanging in the sky, you would recall the physical phenomenon of refraction and reflection. When Himalaya mountains appear before your eyes, geographical theory of plate movement swiftly pop up in your mind. You can tell this interesting truth behind the marvelous scenery to your friends or even get some illumination on your own work. The world would be colorful if you see it in diverse aspects.


Also, having a wide range of knowledge does not hinder your specialization in a specific field. Many historical celebrities around the world have a common feature, they have broad knowledge. Da Vinci is famous for his master piece, Mona lisa, as a professional painter. However, he also made tremendous contribution in archetecture, physics, mathematics and sculpture. It is the profound erudition of Da Vinci that make him a mysterious figure in human history. As for ourselves, it would certainly not a problem of learning knowledge other than your majors during your free time. By doing this, your comprehensive ability could be greatly improved. 

Admittedly, specializing in one specific subject is an essential part in ones career, deserving much more time and effort to spent on. However, in my point of view, it is not enough. With a restricted narrow range of knowledge, you may live a hard life when encounter many circumstances. Consider that every time your friends talking about some current affairs while you have nothing to share about in that field, you are likely to be isolated in social interaction. Therefore it is important to expand our knowledge base meanwhile specialize in one specific subject.

There are so many people doubting on whether a broad knowledge of many academic sujects **take the advantage of** specializing in one specific subject.

We have to realize the fact that the method of learning is more essential rather than the knowledge itself. As we are in the century full of knoeledge and information, just absorbing knowledge is not as important as before. However, to learn the way of study requires some training in that subject and of course those who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects can learn more about different ways of learning in different subjects. **When given a new task, they can easily solve it by using various methods they have learned, who takes a lot advantages from the learning experience.**

Moreove, the distinction among different subjects become less clear. In fact, to solve a problem in a certain aspect may use knowledge in other subjects. Thus it leads us to cover more knowledge instead of just specialize in one specific subject. **For instance, the subject of biochemistry requires the knowledge of chemistry and biology as well. The one having the background of the two subjects can absorb more and discovery more in doing researches, and have more chances of success.**

In fact, to see the famous scientists **in the past**, we will find that most of them specialize in more than on subject. *Aristotle*, one of the most famous philosophies in ancient Greek, knew a lot about the knowledge in science and did researches on such things. As for *Franklin*, he discovered the electricity when having storm, and he also did well in his political career. **From their experience we will learn that it is not the knowledge of a certain subject contributes to their success, instead, it is their way of thinking and the good personality traits lead to their achievement.**

As the saying goes that the knowledge is power, we can draw the conclusion that more knowledge more power. Anyway there is nothing weong in learning new knowledge and perhaps one day it can be used in researches and inventions.
