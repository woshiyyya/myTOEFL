It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

## Writting
It has been a heated discussion about whether a person should specialize in one specific subject or possess wide range of knowledge. Every individual would have his own answer, especially in todays diversified world. I would agree that having a broad knowledge is a better choice.  

A broad knowledge can help us interpret the whole world in different aspects, instruct us to transform the world better. With a wide range of knowledge in many academic subjects, you can find many subtle secrets of the nature that others cannot even notice. When you see a rainbow hanging in the sky, you would recall the physical phenomenon of refraction and reflection. When Himalaya mountains appear before your eyes, geographical theory of plate movement swiftly pop up in your mind. You can tell this interesting truth behind the marvelous scenery to your friends or even get some illumination on your own work. The world would be colorful if you see it in diverse aspects.


Also, having a wide range of knowledge does not hinder your specialization in a specific field. Many historical celebrities around the world have a common feature, they have broad knowledge. Da Vinci is famous for his master piece, Mona lisa, as a professional painter. However, he also made tremendous contribution in archetecture, physics, mathematics and sculpture. It is the profound erudition of Da Vinci that make him a mysterious figure in human history. As for ourselves, it would certainly not a problem of learning knowledge other than your majors during your free time. By doing this, your comprehensive ability could be greatly improved. 

Admittedly, specializing in one specific subject is an essential part in ones career, deserving much more time and effort to spent on. However, in my point of view, it is not enough. With a restricted narrow range of knowledge, you may live a hard life when encounter many circumstances. Consider that every time your friends talking about some current affairs while you have nothing to share about in that field, you are likely to be isolated in social interaction. Therefore it is important to expand our knowledge base meanwhile specialize in one specific subject.
