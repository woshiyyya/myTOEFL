Stepping into the Information Age, the Internet plays an irrepalacable roles in everyones life. An large amount of infromation, such as news, tecnology advancement, celebraty gossip flood onto our screens. It has been disscussed for long that Internet not only brings about valuable information that enrich our life but some severe problems. However, the benefits of Internet would outweigh the deficiencies it might cause.

First of all, the wide range of media sources open up our mind and make our life much more convenient. Before the popularization of Interent, the publics' information sources were restricted in newspaper, television shows, and rideo broadcast. Those information transfered from those sources with limited categories were mostly out-of-style and boring. For example, in a daily newspaper, political issues and advertisements generally covers half of it. Consider that you want to know how to cook a particular dish in previous days. You must spend many hours in the book stores and find which cusine book discribe this dish, while today you just have to type several words in the search engine and get the answer with in a second. It substantially simplify our life and save us more time to do other things.

Furthermore, the Internet gives enerybody a chance of vocalize their oponinosn and reveal the truths. Privously, media sources are generally controlled by government and the public is easily fouled or mislead by so-called mainstream media. Governments try to hide the truth from their people by the media to stablize the society. However, everything has been changed since the advent of Internet. Countless of truths are revealed through out the Internet, valuable information unfolded a compeletely diffenrent aspect of the world. Now, people are taught to consider a problem in various angles before drawing a conclusion. We can freely share our ideas anonymously without hindered by social status in real life.

However, I had to commit that many intricate problems have emerged during the years. False information with malicious intension cause economical and even physical loss to the public. Videos with sexual and violence contents are poisoning children's mind. Malicious internet attack and information fabrication strongly risk the safty of our country, resuting thousand millions dollars cost in keeping a clean Internet environment. There are still many problems we need to handle to make it a stable and reliable tool for human beings.

Internet must be one of the greatest inventions during the 20th century. It shortens the distance between people all over the world by providing various kinds and large amount of information. In my point of view, I agree that Internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which would benefit us without troubling at all.  

By surfing through the Internet, we can get large quantities of useful skills, which can benefit ourselves, from the information that is available on the internet. Learning these skills can help us keep healthy, gain more money or even improve our living standard. In my country, there used to be some isolated villages, where books and knowledge are hard to spread. People living in these villages lack the basic skills to have a good harvest and they live in a very poor condition. Meanwhile, our government has helped them to have access to Internet recently and the villagers can get the information without any difficulties. By using this information, they improved their living conditions. Therefore, information getting from Internet can benefit our lives.  

Another important aspect is the current affairs. Internet could offer us a lot of information about things happend all over the world without people traveling around the world. **From the new scientific discovery to the war in the Middle East, from the economic crisis happened in Europe to the World Cup held in Russia, things happend in every corner of the world can be known in less than a minute through the Internet. Under this circumstance, people can have their own oponions on these affairs, or they can give their hands to the ones who need help. Internet give everyone a chance to learn more about the whole world by providing us information.**

**Admittedly, there is some unreal information on the Internet. On the contrary, I do not think it as a trouble at all. The existance of unreal information forces us to be critical thinking and have the ability to tell the truth. In addition, it is the person who fabricated the news rather than the Internet to be blamed.** 

All in all, the Internet is a great tool to offer us tremendous amout of information. Surrounded by large amount of information can broad our sight and make us more intelligent rather than trap us into troubles.
