## Writing
It is certainly a controversial topic that whether travelling in our own country or traveling to foreign country better. In my oponion, I disagree with the statement above and assume that traveling in other country would bring us about more benefits.

Admittedly, I have to assure that traveling in our own country can make things a lot more easier. A lot of troubles and economical expense could be avoided because we have already been familiar with the national condition. Tourists, tour guides, and local people, they speak the same language, thus making communacation much more easier. However, does it really brings about benefits? It depends on how we define benefits. If we define it as convenience and comfortable, demostic traveling is a better choice. While if we define it as other descriptions, travelling in foreign countries would be better.

Firstly, traveling in foreign countries is more likely to leave us an unforgettable memory.  

Secondly, traveling in a new environment could improve our comprehensive ability in solving problems.

Finally, it is an opportunity to broaden our horizon and extend our personal knowledge in foreign countries that traveling in homeland can not provide.
